TEAM 4  PROPOSAL

Introduction: 
   1. Air pollution and greenhouse gases present major challenges for global health, climate change, and sustainability. Their effects range from health issues like heart and lung diseases to worsening climate conditions, emphasizing the need for sustainable practices. 
   2.The investment sector recognizes its crucial role in environmental sustainability, with environmental impact assessments becoming key for regulatory compliance and meeting sustainability demands. 
   3.This shift indicates a growing trend of incorporating environmental considerations into investment decisions, making the assessment of environmental impacts as critical as financial performance.

Problem Statement:
The main goal of this initiative is to tackle key issues in environmental impact assessments, notably their lack of comprehensiveness, accuracy, and efficiency. 
Current methods face challenges like outdated data, insufficient environmental metrics, and slow processes that delay decision-making.
These flaws limit fund managers' ability to make timely, informed decisions aligned with environmental and financial goals, reducing the effectiveness of sustainability impact funds. 
The project aims to overcome these obstacles, enabling fund managers to implement investment strategies that support environmental sustainability and comply with regulatory standards.

Project Rationale:
This project aims to revolutionize environmental impact reporting for KORU IMPACT SOLUTIONS, focusing on automation to enhance efficiency and insights. By leveraging comprehensive datasets, it introduces a 'return on world' concept, extending beyond financial measures to include broader environmental benefits of sustainable investments. 
It addresses existing data analysis issues in environmental reporting, such as reliance on outdated audit data and the absence of real-time relevance and external data enrichment.

Methodology:
Data Pre-Processing:
In the data pre-processing phase, we carefully evaluated our data sources relating to Greenhouse Gasses & Air Pollution, selecting relevant datasets and identifying quality issues like outliers, inaccuracies, missing or incomplete data, integration challenges, and duplicates. 
Every modification to the dataset, including cleaning, preparation, and integration steps, is documented to ensure accuracy and reliability. We employ visualizations, such as box plots and histograms, to illustrate data quality issues and their resolutions.

For instance, the Ozone Concentration dataset, spanning 1990 to 2015 across various countries, initially showed no missing values in key columns except for 7 missing entries in the 'Code' column, with no duplicates found. The dataset includes 1316 observations, with data collected consistently over the years for 188 entities. 
After addressing the missing 'Code' values, the dataset was fully cleaned, maintaining its original data count and distribution but with adjustments for completeness and accuracy. This cleaned dataset is now a reliable foundation for analyzing ozone concentration trends, demonstrating the importance of thorough data pre-processing for statistical analysis or modeling.

The next dataset examines air pollution mortality rates per 100,000 across countries from 1990 to 2019. Despite it being largely clean, it required removing 690 missing values to ensure accuracy. The cleaning process was streamlined by displaying only the initial rows post-clean-up for efficiency. 
Due to the dataset size, visual representation focused on highlighting general mortality trends over the 29 years, avoiding clutter by not detailing individual country data, thus offering a clear view of air pollution's global health impact.

To enhance the accuracy of metrics on global air quality, incorporating additional datasets focused on greenhouse gases and air pollution is crucial. 

The WHO's 2022 Air Quality Database, updated in April, focuses on ground measurements of NO2, PM10, and PM2.5 across over 600 human settlements in more than 100 countries to represent citywide air quality. This 5th edition mainly covers data from 2010 to 2019 and aims to support the Sustainable Development Goal Indicator 11.6.2 on urban air quality. Data were sourced from official reports, ground measurements, and research projects, ensuring a reliable and comprehensive overview of global air pollution trends

Data Pre-Processing:
The pre-processing phase of this dataset involved deduplication and missing data imputation, enhancing data reliability for global air quality trend insights. This meticulous approach not only streamlined visualization but also bolstered our research foundation, showcasing the dataset's enhanced usability for comprehensive environmental trend analysis.
